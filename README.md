# E-commerce Data Analysis Using SQL

## Overview
This project analyzes an e-commerce dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carrie1/ecommerce-data) using SQL queries. The analysis focuses on key aspects of the data such as orders, customers, sellers, payments, and Recency, Frequency, Monetary (RFM) analysis. 

The analysis results and SQL queries are documented in a Word file, which is included in this repository.

## Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project includes detailed e-commerce transactions from an online store. It contains fields such as:
- **Order Data**: Information about the orders placed by customers.
- **Customer Data**: Details about the customers making the purchases.
- **Seller Data**: Information about the sellers in the marketplace.
- **Payment Data**: Payment details for each transaction.
  
Key fields in the dataset:
- `order_id`: Unique ID for each order.
- `customer_id`: Unique ID for each customer.
- `order_purchase_timestamp`: Date and time when the order was placed.
- `payment_value`: The total amount paid for the order.
- `seller_id`: Unique ID for each seller.
- And more...

## Analysis Breakdown
The project includes the following analyses:
1. **Order Analysis**: 
   - Queries analyzing the number of orders, total sales, and order distribution over time.
2. **Customer Analysis**:
   - Insights into customer demographics, repeat customers, and purchase patterns.
3. **Seller Analysis**:
   - Performance metrics for sellers, including sales volume and product categories.
4. **Payment Analysis**:
   - Analysis of payment methods and transaction amounts.
5. **RFM Analysis**:
   - A Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) model to segment customers based on their purchase behavior.

### Tools Used
- **SQL**: Structured Query Language for data querying and analysis.
- **Word**: A Word document containing detailed analysis results and query explanations.
